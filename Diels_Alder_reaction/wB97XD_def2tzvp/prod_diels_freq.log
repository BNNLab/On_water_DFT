 WE'RE IN THE POSITION OF A VISITOR FROM ANOTHER
 DIMENSION WHO COMES TO EARTH AND SEES A CHESS MATCH.
 ASSUMING HE KNOWS IT'S A GAME, HE'S GOT TWO PROBLEMS:
 FIRST, FIGURE OUT THE RULES, AND SECOND, FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN.
 NINETY PERCENT OF SCIENCE (INCLUDING VIRTUALLY ALL OF CHEMISRY)
 IS IN THAT SECOND CATEGORY.  THEY'RE TRYING TO APPLY
 THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY KNOWN.
